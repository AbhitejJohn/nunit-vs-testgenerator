# NUnit Visual Studio 2015 Test Generator

This is an extension for Visual Studio 2015 that extends
IntelliTest to allow you to create unit tests and IntelliTests.
This extension extends the built in IntelliTest functionality allowing
developers to generate tests using NUnit 2.6.x or NUnit 3.0.

##Visual Studio Enterprise is Required##

Please note that this extension does not generate the tests, it merely
extends IntelliTest to allow it to generate tests using NUnit. Users
should also be aware that **IntelliTest is only available in Visual
Studio Enterprise edition.** Installing this extension in any other
version of Visual Studio will do nothing.

##How to Use##

For more information on using IntelliTest and this extension, please
