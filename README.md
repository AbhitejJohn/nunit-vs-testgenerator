# NUnit Visual Studio Test Generator

This is an extension for Visual Studio that extends
the test functionality to allow you to create unit tests and IntelliTests.
It works for Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017. 
The extension extends the built in test generator functionality allowing
developers to generate tests using NUnit 2.6.x or NUnit 3.x.
